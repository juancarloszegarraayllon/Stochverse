## Session — 2026-05-07/08

### What landed (PRs merged, in order)

- **Phase 0** — `WEB_CONCURRENCY≥2` documented + structlog JSON output +
  FL request-path 30s in-memory cache + `provider_api_call` event
  emitter (PR #66, sha `df59f56`). Operator set `WEB_CONCURRENCY=2` on
  Railway; two worker processes confirmed on next boot.

- **Phase 1A** — SP schema (`sp.*` Postgres schema, 12 tables), Alembic
  init with async template + Neon URL handling, `docker-compose.yml`,
  Makefile dev targets, `.env.example`, `.gitignore` updates
  (PRs #67, #68). Initial migration `8f404e0dc89a` written by hand.

- **Phase 1A migration commit fix** — debugged silent failure where
  `alembic upgrade head` reported success but no DDL persisted. Root
  cause: async SQLAlchemy + Alembic gotcha — `connect()` begin-once
  mode doesn't reliably propagate the COMMIT across the sync/async
  boundary inside `run_sync`. Fix: `transaction_per_migration=True`
  in `context.configure()` + explicit `await connection.commit()`
  after `run_sync`. (PR #69, sha `47aa9ee`)

- **Phase 1A migration applied to production** — Neon DB has the
  `sp` schema with 12 tables and `sp.alembic_version` at revision
  `8f404e0dc89a`. Verified by operator after the env.py fix.

- **Neon password rotation** — operator-driven. Old `neondb_owner`
  password (which had been pasted in chat earlier) was rotated in
  the Neon dashboard. Railway `DATABASE_URL` env var updated to the
  new pooled URL (`-pooler` hostname). Verified by `/healthz` after
  redeploy.

- **Phase 1B — FL ingestion** (PR #70, sha `a8dd0e7`). New
  `ingestion/` package with `base.py` (Protocols, supervisor,
  advisory locks, payload-hash UPSERT), `schema_validation.py`
  (Pydantic boundary validators), `fl.py` (today + week cadence
  loops), `runner.py` (entry point under supervision). 17 unit tests.
  Production confirmed: `ingestion.fl.pass_complete` events flowing,
  ~19k rows in `sp.fl_events` after backfill.

- **Phase 1C — Kalshi REST ingestion** (PR #71, sha `22bbb72`).
  `ingestion/kalshi.py` reads from legacy `_cache["data_all"]`,
  parses each ticker via `kalshi_identity.parse_ticker`, UPSERTs
  to `sp.kalshi_markets`. Same coupling pattern as Phase 1B uses
  for FL. 9 new unit tests.

- **Phase 1 fixes — batch UPSERT, accurate counters, kalshi
  cold-cache priming** (PR #72, sha `2ac0ab8`). Three issues
  surfaced by the first day of production:
  - Cold-cache priming fires `get_data()` in an executor when the
    legacy cache is empty (90s timeout).
  - Counter accuracy: SELECT-first classification before UPSERT;
    counters are correct by construction.
  - FL pass duration 150–275s → 18–30s via multi-row
    `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`. 5–15× faster.

- **Phase 1D — investigated, de-scoped.** A Kalshi WS consumer
  module was shipped (PR #73, sha `89868af`) but found to be a
  silent no-op: `kalshi_ws.LIVE_PRICES` is keyed by **market_ticker**
  (sub-market level) while `sp.kalshi_markets.ticker` PK is
  **event_ticker**. The `WHERE km.ticker = v.ticker` clause never
  matched. Investigation also surfaced that prices already live in
  the legacy `public.prices` table at sub-market granularity,
  populated by `kalshi_ws._price_flush_loop` for both REST and WS
  sources. The right architectural answer: `sp.*` is the entity
  layer, `public.prices` is the price-history layer. Phase 1D was
  removed from scope. The dead code is deleted in this session's
  doc-update PR.

- **Phase 1E — FL backfill script** (PR #74). `scripts/backfill_fl.py`
  pumps indent_days from -7 to +7 through the same ingestion pipeline.
  Operator ran against production Neon and confirmed `sp.fl_events`
  grew to ~19k rows. **`scripts/backfill_kalshi.py` removed** in a
  follow-up commit (`443933e`) — Kalshi REST exposes only currently-
  active and recently-closed events, which the live ingestion already
  pulls every 30s. No useful backfill range. A real Kalshi historical
  backfill would require per-ticker queries against `/markets/{ticker}`
  with a starting list of historical tickers — Phase 2+ if/when needed.

- **Architecture doc v1.4** — boundary statement that
  `public.prices` is a load-bearing dependency of Phase 3 serving;
  system-of-record table covering 14 data classes (canonical
  fixtures, teams + aliases, provider records, sub-market identity
  with the documented redundancy between `sp.kalshi_markets.raw_payload->'outcomes'`
  and `public.markets`, current price snapshots, per-tick price
  history, resolver audit trail, review queue, provider telemetry,
  live scores, legacy entities). v1.3 was discussed but never
  produced as a file artifact; v1.4 supersedes both v1.2 and the
  conceptual v1.3.

### What was investigated and rejected (no code shipped beyond the
deletion of Phase 1D)

- A "field-aware merge" or "separate WS-only columns" approach
  to making `sp.kalshi_markets` price-aware. Rejected because
  `sp.*` was never intended to store prices and `public.prices`
  already does so at sub-market granularity. The doc was updated
  to make this boundary explicit rather than rebuild infrastructure
  that already works.

### Production verification at end of session

- `sp.fl_events`: ~19k rows after FL backfill; passes complete in
  18–30s (down from 150–275s).
- `sp.kalshi_markets`: ~7,325 rows; pass durations 12–17s; counter
  fields (`inserted` / `updated` / `unchanged`) are correct.
- Phase 1D's WS module is deleted; `ingestion.runner.started` will
  emit `task_count=2` going forward.
- `sp.alembic_version` at `8f404e0dc89a`; legacy `public.*` tables
  untouched.

### Open questions for next session

- **Phase 2 resolver scoping.** Architecture doc §7 has the design
  (three-loop pattern, central matcher with confidence scoring,
  `resolution_log`, `review_queue`). Concrete decisions still
  open:
  - Resolver version 0 — what minimum strict-tier match coverage
    is acceptable to start? (Today's pairing is in `kalshi_join.py`;
    porting it as the resolver's strict tier is the obvious starting
    point.)
  - Hot-loop trigger: implement `LISTEN/NOTIFY` immediately, or
    start with a 1s polling loop and add NOTIFY in a follow-up?
  - Admin review-queue UI: what's the minimum viable shape? The
    spec in §7.5 lists auth + list view + side-by-side detail +
    approve/reject + audit log. Phase 2 sub-phases probably want
    auth + list + approve before detail/audit.
  - Confidence threshold for auto-apply vs review-queue routing:
    default 0.85 per §7.4 — verify against real production data
    before locking in.

- **Phase 1F — archival.** Architecture §6.5 says raw provider
  payloads >30 days old archive to object storage. Decision deferred
  this session. The legacy `public.prices` is already pruned via
  `PRICE_RETENTION_HOURS` (default 6), which is acceptable
  steady-state. The `sp.*` provider tables (`fl_events`,
  `kalshi_markets`) don't yet have retention; doing nothing means
  they grow without bound. Phase 1F decides.

- **Phase 4 prep — Polymarket / OddsAPI integration.** Not started.
  The architecture's claim that adding a provider is "a new
  ingestion poller + a new resolver module + configuration entries"
  gets tested for real here.

### Notes for the next session's first 5 minutes

- Run `git pull origin main` to get this session's commits.
- Verify `make test` is green (39 ingestion tests pass).
- Verify production: `sp.kalshi_markets` row count steady, FL passes
  still in the 18–30s range, no `kalshi_ws` mentions in recent logs.
- Re-read this PROJECT_STATE.md before starting Phase 2 design work.
